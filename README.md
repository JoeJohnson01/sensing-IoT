# Sensing & IoT Coursework Submission
## Smart Lift App

## Abstract

This repository details the development of the Smart Lift IoT sensor and mobile application, created as part of the
Sensing and IoT course. The sensor and app allow a user to track their exercises within a gym environment,
providing in depth metrics and progress tracking. The project is built upon cloud infrastructure, making it
scalable to any number of users.

A video demonstrating the project can also be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I02ueaDGH5k&feature=youtu.be

## Repository Files
### Prototyping Folder
Contains sample IMU data, the class written to handle the data, and a sample jupyter notebook that is representative of the cloud functions used

### smartlift.apk
The app developed for the project

### tracker.ino
The code used on the arduino.(not that this is the code for the right sensor. Left sensor code is identical except for different peripheral names and UUIDs)
